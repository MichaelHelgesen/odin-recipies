This is the first project in The Odin Project.

The task is to build a simple web page for recipes to practice HTML knowledge, as well as commiting to Git with good commit messages.

I already know HTML but there is always something to learn! 

In this project I learned a lot about Git that I didn't know, in addition to Linux, navigating with the keyboard in Linux, terminal commandos and keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio Code.
